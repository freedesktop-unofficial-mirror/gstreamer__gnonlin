Release notes for GNonLin Non-Linear Editing Plug-ins 1.4.0


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new feature release
in the 1.0.x stable series of GNonLin.



This module contains a set of plug-ins for GStreamer to ease the
creation of multimedia editors, or any other application where a
timeline-oriented use of GStreamer makes sense.



  Note that this is the last release of the GNonLin set of plugins as
  those elements have been rewritten in big part and in the next release,
  they will be part of the GStreamer Editing Services.



These elements include:

gnlsource
An element for using source elements/bins in a GnlComposition
gnlfilesource
A higher-level element for using a uri in a GnlComposition
gnlcomposition
A container element that handles GNonLin objects
gnloperation
An element for using filters in a GnlComposition
