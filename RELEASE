Release notes for GNonLin Non-Linear Editing Plug-ins 1.3.90


The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of
the stable 1.4 release series. The 1.4 release series is adding new features
on top of the 1.0 and 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x
release series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.


This release candidate will hopefully shortly be followed by the stable 1.4.0
release if no bigger regressions or bigger issues are detected, and enough
testing of the release candidate happened. The new API that was added during
the 1.3 release series is not expected to change anymore at this point.



This module contains a set of plug-ins for GStreamer to ease the
creation of multimedia editors, or any other application where a
timeline-oriented use of GStreamer makes sense.


These elements include:

gnlsource
An element for using source elements/bins in a GnlComposition
gnlfilesource
A higher-level element for using a uri in a GnlComposition
gnlcomposition
A container element that handles GNonLin objects
gnloperation
An element for using filters in a GnlComposition
